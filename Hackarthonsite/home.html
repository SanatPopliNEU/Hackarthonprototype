        <h1>Mental Health: An Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious
            medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way 
            you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. 
            Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest 
            in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional
            and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work 
            and at home.
